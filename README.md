# DejaBrewPOS
Task 6: Developing Software &amp; Programming Project

# Part 1: Basic POS System
This version will be a simple console application with just the basic functionality of the program.

# Part 2: Improved POS System
This version will be the same as part 1 but will use a GUI library, rather than just text.
I will probably use a cross-platform library for this rather than regular Windows GUI stuff,
not just because it will allow me to make binaries for Windows and Linux, but also because
I just HATE developing on Windows.

I was planning to use GTK, but setting up the development prerequisites was an absolute pain.

I might use the [imgui library](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
