# DejaBrewPOS
Task 6: Developing Software &amp; Programming Project

# Part 1: Basic POS System
This version will be a simple console application with just the basic functionality of the program.

# Part 2: Improved POS System
This version will be the same as part 1 but will use a GTK GUI, rather than just text.
I have chosen GTK over native Windows GUI stuff because it is cross-platform and I just prefer
development on Linux hosts.
