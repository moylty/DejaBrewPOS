# DejaBrewPOS
Task 6: Developing Software &amp; Programming Project

# Part 1: Basic POS System
This version will be a simple console application with just the basic functionality of the program.

# Part 2: Improved POS System
This version will be the same as part 1 but will use a GUI library, rather than just text.
I will probably use a cross-platform library for this rather than regular Windows GUI stuff,
not just because it will allow me to make binaries for Windows and Linux, but also because
I just HATE developing on Windows.

I was considering either using GTK or imgui, but ultimately I decided on using Qt.
Qt is better cross-platform compared to GTK, as well as being easier to set up for Windows
development. Imgui seemed too complicated, especially for the relatively simple program I
was going to make with it.

Qt allows me to develop and compile my code on my Linux PC, and then cross-compile it into a
Windows binary.
