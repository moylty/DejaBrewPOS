# DejaBrewPOS
Task 6: Developing Software &amp; Programming Project

# Part 1: Basic POS System
This version will be a simple console application with just the basic functionality of the program.

# Part 2: Improved POS System
This version will be the same as part 1 but will use a Qt GUI, rather than just text.
I have chosen Qt over native Windows GUI stuff because it is cross-platform and I just prefer
development on Linux hosts.

I was initially going to use GTK for this, but it turns out Qt is better on Windows compared to GTK.
GTK's focus is almost entirely on Linux, whereas Qt is more balanced across platforms.
