# This is NOT the final version of part 2.

That would be qtc-part2.

This version was made from scratch, not using any Qt design software.

The other version, qtc-part2 was made using the Qt creator IDE, which
is the reccommended development process.

This version is abandoned and can be ignored. The only reason I am not
deleting it is because I may need to reference it while developing the
newer version.
